• Created a skip-gram word embedding model using Adam as the optimizer to analyze word similarity in a
custom corpus, minimising Cross Entropy Loss using NLTK and spaCy within the PyTorch framework
• Fine-tuned the DistilBERT model from the Hugging Face library achieving a classification accuracy of 89%
